What is this?
===
An automation project to help me find a coop job.

Why?
---
Because browsing through job sites takes too much work; open browser, select the appropriate search filters, browser through jobs.

How?
---
Uses Selenium to go through several job sites (mainly PlaceproCanada) to scrap job postings and post them to my Google Calendar that is designated for coop job postings.


> python runner.py

Hooks everything up.

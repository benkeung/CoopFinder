What is this?
=============

An automation project to help me find a coop job?

=============
Why?
=============
Why? Because browsing through job sites takes too much work; open browser, select the appropriate search filters, browser through jobs.

What this does?
==============

Uses Selenium to go through several job sites (mainly PlaceproCanada) to scrap job postings and post them to my Google Calendar that is designated for coop job postings.
